# Candidate Service

## Introduction

The Candidate [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) Service is a RESTful Web Service, backed by [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). The Candidate service exposes several HTTP API endpoints, listed below. API users can retrieve a list candidates, add a new candidate, and inspect technical information about the running service. API users can also create a sample list of candidates, based on the 2016 US Presidential Election, by calling the `/simulation` endpoint.

The Candidate service is designed to work along with the [Voter Service](https://github.com/garystafford/voter-service), as part of a complete API. The Voter service is dependent on the Candidate service to supply a list of candidates. The Candidate service is called by the Voter service, using one of three methods:
1. [HTTP-based Synchronous IPC](https://www.nginx.com/blog/building-microservices-inter-process-communication/), when either the Voter service's `/voter/candidates/http/{election}` or `/voter/simulation/http/{election}` endpoints are called.
2. [Messaging-based Remote Procedure Call (RPC) IPC](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-six-spring-amqp.html), when either the Voter service's `/voter/candidates/rpc/{election}` or `/voter/simulation/rpc/{election}` endpoints are called.
3. [Messaging-based Eventual Consistency](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-spring-amqp.html), when either the Voter service's `/voter/candidates/db/{election}` or `/voter/simulation/db/{election}` endpoints are called.

## Quick Start for Local Development

The Candidate service requires MongoDB to be running locally, on port `27017`, RabbitMQ running on `5672` and `15672`, and the Voter service to be running on `8099`. To clone, build, test, and run the Candidate service as a JAR file, locally:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 --branch rabbitmq \
  https://github.com/garystafford/candidate-service.git
cd candidate-service
./gradlew clean cleanTest build
java -jar build/libs/candidate-service-0.3.0.jar
```

## Getting Started with the API
The easiest way to get started with the Candidate and Voter services API, using [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/) from the command line:  
1. Create sample candidates: `http http://localhost:8097/candidate/simulation`  
2. View sample candidates: `http http://localhost:8097/candidate/candidates/summary/2016%20Presidential%20Election`  
3. Create sample voter data: `http http://localhost:8099/voter/simulation/2016%20Presidential%20Election`  
4. View sample voter results: `http http://localhost:8099/voter/results`

Alternately, for step 3 above, you can use service-to-service RPC IPC with RabbitMQ, to retrieve the candidates:  
`http http://localhost:8099/voter/simulation/rpc/2016%20Presidential%20Election`

Alternately, for step 3 above, you can use eventual consistency using RabbitMQ, to retrieve the candidates from MongoDB:  
`http http://localhost:8099/voter/simulation/db/2016%20Presidential%20Election`
## Service Endpoints

The service uses a context path of `/candidate`. All endpoints must be are prefixed with this sub-path.

Purpose                                                                                                                  | Method  | Endpoint

Other [HATEOAS](https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-hateoas) endpoints for `/candidate/candidates`                                    | Various | DELETE, PATCH, PUT, page sort, size, etc.

The [HAL Browser](https://github.com/mikekelly/hal-browser) API browser for the `hal+json` media type is installed alongside the service. It can be accessed at `http://localhost:8097/candidate/actuator/`.

## New Candidate

Adding a new candidate requires an HTTP `POST` request to the `/candidate/candidates` endpoint, as follows:

HTTPie

```text
http POST http://localhost:8097/candidate/candidates \
  firstName='Mary' \
  lastName='Smith' \
  politicalParty='Test Party' \
  election='2016 Presidential Election'
```

cURL

```text
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "firstName": "Mary", "lastName": "Smith", "politicalParty": "Test Party", "election": "2016 Presidential Election" }' \
  "http://localhost:8097/candidate/candidates"
```

wget

```text
wget --method POST \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --body-data '{ "firstName": "Mary", "lastName": "Smith", "politicalParty": "Test Party", "election": "2016 Presidential Election" }' \
  --no-verbose \
  --output-document - http://localhost:8097/candidate/candidates
```

## Continuous Integration

The project's source code is continuously built and tested on every commit to [GitHub](https://github.com/garystafford/candidate-service), using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/garystafford/candidate-service). If all unit tests pass, the resulting Spring Boot JAR is pushed to the `build-artifacts` branch of the [candidate-service](https://github.com/garystafford/candidate-service/tree/build-artifacts) GitHub repository. The JAR's filename is incremented with each successful build (i.e. `candidate-service-0.3.18.jar`).

## Spring Profiles

The Candidate service includes several Spring Boot Profiles, in a multi-profile YAML document: `src/main/resources/application.yml`. The profiles are `default`, `docker-development`, `docker-production`, and `aws-production`. You will need to ensure your MongoDB instance is available at that `host` address and port of the profile you choose, or you may override the profile's properties.

```yaml
endpoints:
  enabled: true
  sensitive: false
info:
  java:
    source: "${java.version}"
logging:
  level:
    root: INFO
management:
  info:
    build:
      enabled: true
    git:
      mode: full
server:
  port: 8097
  context-path: /candidate
spring:
  data:
    mongodb:
      database: candidates
      host: localhost
      port: 27017
  rabbitmq:
    host: localhost
---
spring:
  data:
    mongodb:
      host: mongodb
  rabbitmq:
    host: rabbitmq
  profiles: docker-local
---
---
endpoints:
  enabled: false
  health:
    enabled: true
  info:
    enabled: true
  sensitive: true
logging:
  level:
    root: WARN
management:
  info:
    build:
      enabled: false
    git:
      enabled: false
spring:
  data:
    mongodb:
      host: "10.0.1.6"
  rabbitmq:
    host: "10.0.1.8"
  profiles: aws-production
---
endpoints:
  enabled: false
  health:
    enabled: true
  info:
    enabled: true
  sensitive: true
logging:
  level:
    root: WARN
management:
  info:
    build:
      enabled: false
    git:
      enabled: false
spring:
  data:
    mongodb:
      host: mongodb
  rabbitmq:
    host: rabbitmq
  profiles: docker-production
```

All profile property values may be overridden on the command line, or in a .conf file. For example, to start the Candidate service with the `aws-production` profile, but override the `mongodb.host` value with a new host address, you might use the following command:

```bash
java -jar <name_of_jar_file> \
  --spring.profiles.active=aws-production \
  --spring.data.mongodb.host=<new_host_address>
  -Dlogging.level.root=DEBUG \
  -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom
```
